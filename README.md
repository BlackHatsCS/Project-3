============
Sorting Algorithms
-----------------
The main traget of this projkect is to implament a sorting algorithm.
It will be used to sort the order of treasures once they have all been collected by the robot.
So we need to decide on the algorithm that we are going tyo be using.
There are a few good choices that we could use that would all work as well as each other.

-----------
Pathfinding
------------
There are slight changes that need to be made to the pathfinding of the robot.
IT now is going tro have multiple treasures on the screen at a time tyhat it can go to.
But it needs to go to the closest treasure to itself at the current moment in time.

------------
Traps
---------
There are going to be randomly spawning treaps at locations that when the robotr goes over them it will remobve the most recent treasure added.
We have also decided that we are are going to add a few more traps that each dop a different thing to the list of reeasures.

---------
User inputs
--------
The user is requires to be abler to choose the spawn locations of ther robot and all of the treasures.
We are planning on making it so that they do this before anything on the screen has spawning meaninign that there program will run smoother.
